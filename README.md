Frontend: HTML (Semantic UI) + CSS + Javascript (Vanilla + Jqeury)
We choose this frontend tech stack because every one is familiar with HTML/CSS/Javascript and they align with the project requirement.

Templating: Pug
We use Pug as it has clean syntax.

Backend: Node.js + Express.js + Socket.io + JWT + Passport.js (?)
We choose to use Node.js and Express.js as they align with the project requirement. Socket.io is used for real-time update, JWT and Passport.js is for token and authentication

Database: PostgreSQL / AWS RDS with SQL
We choose to use SQL as we think the relational database is a better choice for this project given the relationship between data

Cloud: AWS / Heroku
We choose AWS / Heroku as they are the most popular choices and most of our team members have experience with them
