## Tech stack
**Frontend**: HTML (Semantic UI) + CSS + Javascript (Vanilla + Jqeury)

We choose this frontend tech stack because every one is familiar with HTML/CSS/Javascript and they align with the project requirement.

**Templating**: Pug

We use Pug as it has clean syntax.

**Backend**: Node.js + Express.js + Socket.io + JWT + Passport.js (?)

We choose to use Node.js and Express.js as they align with the project requirement. Socket.io is used for real-time update, JWT and Passport.js is for token and authentication

**Database**: MongoDB + Mongoose, hosted on MongoDB Atlas
We choose MongoDB as it is one of the most popular NoSQL database, which provides better flexibility than SQL databases so we could easily change the schema of our database. Mongoose is used to control the schema and add behavior to the database.

**Cloud**: AWS / Heroku
We choose AWS / Heroku as they are the most popular choices and most of our team members have experience with them
